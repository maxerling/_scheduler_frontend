# Scheduler

## Introduction

This is a scheduler made with Typescript, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Bulma and some custom CSS.

As a user you start with accessing the login page and use the [User Info](#user-info) to login to scheduler.



**!: First time you try to login, you will need to wait for the server to start!**

## Reflection

Was a fun project to work on. Something that I noticed with the frontend was that I was lacking a lot when it comes to the structure of code. Compared  to using React, it's hard to 'naturally' structure the code with just JS/TS. Something that I need to think about in future projects. Learned a lot when it comes to identifying the problem, break it down and rephrase it into something that is 'googleable'.  More cohesive error handling instead of just returning a status code.

Was using Parcel as my bundler and had some unique problems when it came to how my code was running locally compared to  my prod env.

Overall really appreciate the experience!
